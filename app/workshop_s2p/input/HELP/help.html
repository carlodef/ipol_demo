<p>OpenCV variant of the famous Semi-Global Matching (SGM) algorithm by Heiko Hirschmuller [HH08], that differs from the original one as follows:</p>
<p>Mutual information cost function is not implemented. Instead, a simpler Birchfield-Tomasi sub-pixel metric from [BT98] is used. Though, the color images are supported as well. Some pre- and post- processing steps from K. Konolige algorithm are included, for example: pre-filtering (CV_STEREO_BM_XSOBEL type) and post-filtering (uniqueness check, quadratic interpolation and speckle filtering).</p>

<p>Multi-scale multi-window block matching algorithm. As cost function we use the zero-mean SSD (ZSSD) [27] which removes the average intensity of each patch rendering the comparison independent of the mean intensity. This cost is defined as</p>

<p>More Global Matching. Variant of SGM which injects information from the 2D problem in the processing of SGM 1D paths.</p>
