      <a href="http://cvlab.epfl.ch/~strecha/multiview/denseMVS.html">Fountain from: C. Strecha dense multiview stereo dataset.</a><br/>
      Real scene, laser scan ground truth? high b/h (must compute) . <br/>
      Factor 4 subsampling of frames 03 and 02 of the "fountain" sequence. <br/>
      Rectification computed using the gound truth data, applying the Fusiello-Irsara method. <br/>
      Points re-projected with the known camera matrices, and applying to the points the homografies from the rectification. 
      (Notice that the displacement of the points should be only horizontal, however we observe a small displacement in the vertical 
      axis. )<br/>
      Unknown noise level, probably very low after resampling, error due to quantization noise with standard deviation 0.2887.<br/>
      Unknown MTF but original images are band limited <br/>
      Evaluation masks excludes boundaries and occluded areas. <br/>

      Procedure : subsample, rectify, apply transformations to the point clouds (camera, scaling and homografy), compute occlusions

      Reprojection displacement in the vertical axis, the value of this displacement generally is between [-.06, .25] pixels.
