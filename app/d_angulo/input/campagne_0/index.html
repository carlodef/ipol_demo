      Simulated b/H : 0.0037. <br/>
      Subsample by a factor 4 of the "Campagne1" images resulting in 600x400 images. <br/>
      Quantized values [0,255], standard deviation of quantization error = 0.2887. (SNR:48dB)<br/>
      Gaussian MTF with sigma = 0.8 <br/>
      Original images have gaussian MTF with sigma=1.4, 
      to obtain alias free subsampled images (factor 4) sigma of the original image must be 3.2. 
      Images corrected with gaussian filter std=sqrt(3.2^2 - 1.4^2)=2.877 previous to sampling.<br/>
      Evaluation masks excludes boundaries and occluded areas. <br/>

Subsampling the images
----------------------
The original images are already convolved by a gaussian with 
std=1.4, which is almost the good variance for subsampling 
the imaged by a factor 2 (1.6 = 2 x 0.8).  To attain this level 
of filtering we filter by a gaussian with std  sqrt(1.6^2 - 1.4^2) = 0.775. 

If we whant to subsample by a larger factor let's say 4, 
then the high resolution image must be fitered with a gaussian with 
std = 0.8 x 4 = 3.2, so the correction for the current image should 
be a gaussian with std sqrt(3.2^2 - 1.4^2)  = 2.877
